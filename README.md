# Overview

This repository contains a basic sample app that can receive push notifications sent from its Telerik Platform backend. It is a hybrid app built using Telerik AppBuilder and Cordova.

The sample app utilizes the following Telerik products and SDKs:

- [Telerik Backend Services JavaScript SDK](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/backend-services/javascript/getting-started-javascript-sdk)&mdash;to connect the app to Telerik Platform
- [Telerik Push Plugin](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/PushNotification) for AppBuilder&mdash;to enable push notifications in Cordova

# Requirements

Before you begin, you need to ensure that you have the following:

- **An active [Telerik Platform](https://platform.telerik.com) account**
Ensure that you can log in to a Telerik Platform account. This can be a free trial account.
- **Telerik AppBuilder**
The sample app requires Telerik AppBuilder to run. This can be the in-browser client, the desktop client or the extension for Visual Studio.

# Configuration

The sample app comes fully functional, but to see it in action you must link it to a Telerik Platform app.

1. Click the **Run in the Platform** button to clone the repository in Telerik Platform.<br>
	A new Telerik Platform app is created for you. You can view the app source code on the Code tab.
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
5. Take note of your **App ID**.
6. Go to the **Code** tab.
7. Open the `/scripts/app/main.js` file.
8. Locate the `appId` variable and replace its value with the App ID that you acquired earlier.
9. If you want to run the app on Android devices, locate the `googleApiProjectNumber` variable and replace its value with your Google project number. More details on obtaining the project number can be found on [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#projectnumber).
10. Finally, got to the **Notifications > Push Notifications** tab and set up push notifications as explained in [Enabling Push Notifications](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/backend-services/javascript/push-notifications/push-enabling).

# Running the Sample

Once the app is configured, you can run it on a real device. To run it, follow the steps in the product's documentation: [Running Apps on Devices](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/testing-your-app/running-on-devices/working-with-devices).

> When running the app, ensure that you are building it as an app package as opposed to an AppBuilder companion app package.

> Push notifications are not supported when running the app on device simulators/emulators. 

> Ensure that the device that you are using has Internet connectivity when running the sample.
